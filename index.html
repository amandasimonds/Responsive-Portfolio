            I grew up in Baltimore, Maryland, and moved to Denver 2 years ago. I moved here for the sunshine and mountains.

            I graduated from Maryland Institute College of Art with a Masters of Arts in Teaching. This is my 5th year teaching Kindergarten - 5th grade art. I love teaching, but want to try a new career that gives me more opportunities to work independently, and climb to a higher salary.

            In middle school and high school I taught myself html and css so I could fool around with website design. Sometimes I did this on xanga and myspace.

            I love animals, so please hire me as your petsitter if you need a good one. :)
